# Election_Analysis

In this election audit, we have collected 3 different counties' election data, which are: Jefferson, Denver and Araphaoe. We analyzed current election results based on the distribution of total votes from each county and candidate. 
With the purpose of automating future election audit process, we have created a program that can accurately analyze election results in a matter of minutes. The following election results are the first election audit we have produced with our new automated script. 

## Election Audit Results:

We have collected 369,711 total votes as the result of this election. County Votes are distributed as the follwoings:

- Jefferson:  10.5% of the total votes  (38855 of votes)
- Denver:  82.8% of the total votes (306055 of votes)
- Arapahoe: 6.7%  of the total votes (24801 of votes)

The county with the highest turnover is clearly goes to **Denver**. 

Next let's take a look at our election results by our candidates:

- Charles Casper Stockham: recieved 23.0% of the total votes.
- Diana DeGette: recieved 73.8% of the total votes.
- Raymon Anthony Doane: recieved 3.1% of the total votes.

A handsome vistory is achieved by a large amount of 272,892 votes goes to **Diana DeGette**. Diana DeGette became our undouthful winner with her winning over 73% of the total votes.

## Election-Audit Summary

As you can see from the above result, our automated script can provide election audit for any election date with a few modifications. 
Possible modifications in the future could be as follows:

1. File names has to be updated in the script in order to load the correct data.

2. File formats has to be generally similair to the current election data csv file. 

3. File path should be updated if we decide to use different path and folders for each different year's election data.

By appliying this script, we can not only avoid human error in the audit process, also get to the accurate election results a lot faster than our previous process.
